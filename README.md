This repository contains a collection of Data Science Lab Works conducted during my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program. The lab experiments are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and focus on various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each experiment demonstrates different techniques, algorithms, and tools that were learned during the course, including data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and building machine learning models.
